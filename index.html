            My name is Chen Ee Heng. I usually introduce myself as <font color="Lime">Chen</font>. However, despite it
            being placed first, it is not my first name, but rather my family name. My name comes from the
            romanization of 3 Chinese characters, which refers to my family name, my generation name, and <em>my
                name</em>. And yes, all of my siblings and cousins from my father's side have the same generation name
            <em>Ee</em>, not bad right? So why do I still introduce myself as Chen? Simple, it is easy to pronounce for
            native and non-native English speakers.
            <!-- But for the brave hearted, you may call me <b>Ee Heng</b>. In
            chinese you do not call people by a single character/word, it just doesn't work. -->
            If you are wondering why I
            have a Chinese name, it is because I am a third-generation Chinese descendant from the beautiful country of
            Malaysia.
            <!-- My family still follows quite a lot of the chinese culture, including speaking the mandarin
            language. Besides mandarin, -->
            And yes, besides English I speak Mandarin Chinese, Bahasa Malaysia (the official language of Malaysia),
            and German. But of course, being a programmer, I also speak Python3, C++, Matlab, and
            HTML languages &#128515.

            Some information about what I do officially: I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at <a
                href="https://www.mirmi.tum.de/" target="_blank">
                <font color="Cyan">MIRMI</font>
            </a>, where I am working on the <a
                href="https://www.deutsches-herzzentrum-muenchen.de/research/digital-heart-surgery-lighthouse-project/?lang=en"
                target="_blank">
                <font color="Cyan">Digital Heart Surgery</font>
            </a> project in collaboration with the German Heart Centre Munich. In the project, I help coordinate the
            research activities between the PIs at MIRMI and the doctors at the German Heart Centre Munich and also
            look into ways to assist clinicians in the ICU using cameras. You can read more about it <a href=/projects/

            </a>. Before this, I did an industrial PhD with the German automobile manufacturer BMW in the field of
            autonomous driving under the supervision of Jöran Zeisler from BMW and <a
                href="https://mvp.in.tum.de/"" target=" _blank">
                <font color="Cyan">Darius Burschka</font>
            </a> from the Technical University of Munich. In my PhD dissertation <a
                href="https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/1632364" target="_blank">
                <font color="Cyan">"Development of vision-based driving strategies for traffic junction scenarios"
                </font>
            </a>, I developed a vision-based system that takes in camera images as input and decides whether a
            traffic junction is safe to be crossed. The system uses convolutional neural network-based models to extract
            information about the traffic scene as intermediate representations and uses them to make the final
            decision with the help of a Bayesian network. I believe systems that use intermediate representations are
            the way to go, especially when discussing safe and explainable AI.

            When I am not doing <em>official</em> stuff, I can be seen roaming around shops, scouring ingredients to
            make good food. If not, I am probably spending too much time on Twitter reading about AI or on Youtube
            looking at the next travel destination. I have been living and traveling in europe for the past decade, so I
            am open to suggestions for travels outside of europe! Currently I am staying in Munich (see photo below).

    <!-- <p>Some more info about me: I am currently bla bla bla. Before that, I did my PhD at the <a

            <font color="brown">Institute for Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC)</font>

        In my dissertation - titled <a href="https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/48164248/Thesis.pdf"
            target="blank"><i>Hierarchy and interpretability in neural models of language processing</i></a> - I studied
        artificial neural networks for natural language processing, with as main aim to understand what they may teach
        us about processing of structure.
        While artificial neural networks are of course far from the real brain, I hope that understanding the principles
        by which they can encode and process structure can teach us something that will lead to a better understanding
        of how language is processed by the human brain.
