The resume layouts nowadays are getting really creative, too creative sometimes. I like the layouts where there is a sidebar with author's information on it. But the layouts that uses bars or stars to rate skills are in my opinion not very informative. Is it for faster visual comprehension/comparison? If so whats stopping the author from putting full stars? If anyone has an idea about this, please let me know! <br /><br />

In the meantime, here is my old school resume :<a href="/assets/docs/ResumeChen230423.pdf" target="_blank"><font color="Cyan"><i class="fa fa-2x fa-file-pdf" aria-hidden="true"></i> Resume</font></a>

### In a nutshell:
- I have ~5 years of experience working in the industry as a student and as a PhD candidate.
- I have 7 years of computer vision research experience. I worked with KinectV1 and Realsense RGBD cameras, and used mainly opencv, tensorflow, and pytorch libraries for my research.
- I have enough experience with Python and C++ to read and debug codes.
- I have enough experience to start working with tasks involving Kubernetes and Docker. (<em>I actually enjoy doing this a lot.<em/>)
- I have experience coordinating interdisciplinary project.
- I have experience supervising student work.
